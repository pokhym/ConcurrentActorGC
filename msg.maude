	--- I guess there should be another kind of message for asking an actor to take a snapshot?
	--- An App message can do any combination of the following things all at once
	--- - Add all references in the message to the target actorâ€™s state; AND
	--- - Create new App messages, each of which may contain a set of new references; AND
	--- - Spawn new actors; AND
	--- - Create new Req_Release messages.
	--- TODO: This means that we need newActor to handle cases where ActorList is MT
