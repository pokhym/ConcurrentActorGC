# ConcurrentActorGC

This repository contains an executable specification of the algorithm linked in the sources.
In addition to this, this repository also contains the proof of properties such as completeness and soundess of the algorithm.

Note that the paper linked below is does not contain the final algorithm as optimizations have been made since its publication.
However, these optimizations will be included in the specfication.
